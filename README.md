# news_search
This is a small-scale news search project tool using OpenAI embeddings. The embeddings for the news articles are saved in a pickle file. These can then be queried using the search box in the UI.

The left sidebar is used to convert the content of a few articles into a pickle file. This is saved in the root of the project.
